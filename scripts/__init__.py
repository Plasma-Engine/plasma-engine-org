"""Top-level package marker for the repository's automation scripts.

This file exists so that Python treats the `scripts` directory as a package.
Doing so allows companion tooling (for example, the autopilot orchestrator)
to import helper modules such as `scripts.automation.cursor_dispatch` without
resorting to brittle `sys.path` manipulations. Keeping the package explicit
also reinforces the repository's documentation rule to include detailed
explainers alongside automation source files.

No runtime logic lives here by designâ€”future maintainers can extend the
package by adding shared helpers in sibling modules while retaining this file
as lightweight context.
