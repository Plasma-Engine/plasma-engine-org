## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate (P0 completion)
1. **Python Version**: Upgrade services to Python 3.11+ (required by pyproject.toml)
2. **Gateway Tests**: Fix health endpoint test failures
3. **JWT Auth (PE-102)**: Implement authentication middleware
4. **GraphQL Federation (PE-103)**: Configure Apollo Gateway with service mesh
5. **Infrastructure (PE-601-609)**: Set up Docker Compose and databases

### Testing Phase
1. Run full test suites with 90%+ coverage
2. Fix any failing tests
3. Generate coverage reports

### Review Phase
1. Monitor CodeRabbit automated reviews
2. Address review comments
3. Request human review for P0 critical PRs

### Merge Strategy
1. Merge P0 issues first (foundation)
2. Then P1 high priority
3. Finally P2/P3 enhancements

## üîß Technical Issues Encountered

1. **GitHub Label Creation**: Labels don't exist in repos, worked around with title prefixes
2. **Bash Script Compatibility**: macOS bash doesn't support `${var,,}` syntax
3. **Python Version**: Services require Python 3.10+ for modern union syntax
4. **Gateway GraphQL**: Apollo Gateway can't connect to subgraph services (not running locally)
5. **Test Failures**: Health endpoint tests need server address fixes

---

## üí° Recommendations

1. **Python Environment**: Use Python 3.11+ as specified in pyproject.toml
2. **Docker First**: Start services via Docker Compose before running integration tests
3. **GraphQL**: Implement subgraph schemas before testing federation
4. **CI/CD**: Ensure GitHub Actions use correct Python/Node versions
5. **Labels**: Create standard labels in all repositories (P0-critical, P1-high, etc.)
