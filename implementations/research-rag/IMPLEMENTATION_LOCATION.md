# RAG Query Engine Implementation Location

## Important Note

The full implementation for the RAG Query Engine (PE-206) has been created in the following directory:

```
plasma-engine-research/
```

However, since this directory is ignored by git (as it's meant to be a separate repository), the implementation files cannot be committed from here.

## Implementation Files Created

The following files have been successfully created:

- `plasma-engine-research/app/rag/context_manager.py` - Context window management
- `plasma-engine-research/app/rag/api.py` - FastAPI endpoints
- `plasma-engine-research/app/rag/__init__.py` - Module initialization

### Application Setup
- `plasma-engine-research/app/main.py` - Main FastAPI application
- `plasma-engine-research/requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `plasma-engine-research/.env.example` - Environment configuration template

### Documentation & Examples
- `plasma-engine-research/README_RAG.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `plasma-engine-research/app/rag/examples.py` - Usage examples

### Tests
- `plasma-engine-research/tests/test_rag.py` - Unit tests

## How to Use This Implementation

1. **Clone the actual plasma-engine-research repository** (when available):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/plasma-engine/plasma-engine-research.git
   ```

2. **Copy the implementation files** from `plasma-engine-research/` directory in this repository to the cloned repository.

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd plasma-engine-research
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure environment**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys and configuration
   ```

5. **Run the service**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```
