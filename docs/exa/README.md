# Exa API Reference (Stubs)

This directory mirrors Exa API schemas, example queries, and authentication flows as authoritative references for developers.

IMPORTANT: These are placeholders pending validation via Rube MCP.

- `schemas/` – JSON/YAML schemas for requests/responses
- `examples/` – Example queries and responses
- `auth.md` – Authentication flows and token handling

# TODO: Retrieve official Exa docs via Rube MCP and populate schemas and examples.
