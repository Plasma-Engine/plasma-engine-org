 > Daily build log of DevOps stack work. Include commands, outputs, artifacts, open questions, and dependencies.

 ## 2025-09-25

 - Files touched:
   - `docs/devops/README.md` (new)
   - `docs/devops/activity-log.md` (new)
 - Commands run:
   - `git status -sb` — verified working branch
   - `python3 --version`, `node --version`, `npm --version` — verified toolchain
   - `mkdir -p docs/devops/{playbooks,runbooks,release} docs/exa` — initialized docs structure
 - Current branch: `cursor/setup-full-devops-stack-and-workflows-3f5e`
 - Tooling present: Python 3.13.3, Node v22.16.0, npm 10.9.2
 - Tooling missing: Terraform (terraform fmt/apply unavailable), pipx, poetry
 - Blockers / notes:
   - Rube MCP not accessible in this environment. Falling back to local knowledge and will insert `# TODO:` to validate against Rube MCP later.
   - Web search tool returned non-authoritative summaries without URLs. `# TODO:` Replace placeholder references with authoritative links via Rube MCP.
   - Subprojects (`plasma-engine-*`) not present in current workspace snapshot. `# TODO:` Confirm full monorepo checkout and paths before wiring service-specific CI.
 - Next actions:
   - Scaffold Terraform module directories and environment (`plasma-engine-infra/infra/terraform/...`).
   - Create CI/CD workflows in `.github/workflows/` that reference `ci/` composites.
   - Author runbooks, release checklists, and SOPs aligned to the automation.
   - Mirror Exa API schemas and example queries into `docs/exa/`.
 - Dependencies needed from other agents:
   - Security: Approved baseline controls for IAM, networking, and secrets management.
   - Platform: Cloud provider choice and org/account IDs, naming conventions, regions.
   - Research: Confirm Exa API versions/models to mirror.
