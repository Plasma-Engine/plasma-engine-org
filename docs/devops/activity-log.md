## 2025-09-25

### Context
Workspace mounted at `/workspace`. Full monorepo path provided by user is not
mounted here, so work proceeds in this workspace with mirrored structure.

### Actions
- Created DevOps docs scaffold: `docs/devops/README.md`, `runbooks/`,
  `release/`, `playbooks/`, and this activity log.
- Started planning Terraform module scaffold under `plasma-engine-infra/`.

### Commands and Outputs
```bash
git status -sb
```
Result: repository present on branch `cursor/build-full-devops-stack-and-operationalize-f0d6`; output captured in workspace shell history.

### Blockers / TODOs
- # TODO: Rube MCP not accessible in this environment; cannot fetch external
  best practices or Exa API schemas directly. Use placeholders and mark gaps.
- # TODO: Confirm whether infra repo should live as submodule or subdirectory.

### Next Actions
- Scaffold Terraform reusable modules and dev env wiring.
- Add CI/CD workflows and developer scripts.
- Mirror Exa API docs placeholders and fill in once MCP is available.
