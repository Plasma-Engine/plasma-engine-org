- Added CI/CD workflow definitions under `ci/` and `.github/workflows/`.
- Scaffolded Terraform modules and `envs/dev` wiring in `plasma-engine-infra`.
- Authored runbooks and release checklist; added Exa reference stubs.
- Added developer scripts for onboarding, local testing, and deployment.

Files touched
- `docs/devops/README.md`

Commands run
```bash
git status -sb
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
git remote -v
# Validation
bash -n scripts/*.sh
python3 -m py_compile scripts/research-exa.py
jq . docs/exa/schemas/*.json  # if jq installed
terraform fmt -recursive -check plasma-engine-infra/infra/terraform  # if terraform installed
```

Outputs (abridged)
- Branch: cursor/build-full-devops-stack-and-workflows-ce66
- Remote: origin set
- Shell script syntax: OK for all files
- Python syntax: OK for `scripts/research-exa.py`
- JSON lint: jq not installed; skipped

Blockers / TODOs
- # TODO: Rube MCP is not available in this environment; external references (best practices, Exa samples, compliance specs) must be validated via MCP in a later pass.
- # TODO: Monorepo application directories not present in current workspace snapshot; defer dependency installation checks to when packages are available.
- # TODO: Pin Terraform provider and backend strategy once cloud is selected.
- # TODO: Implement concrete CI steps (ruff/black/eslint/trivy) once toolchains are installed.

Next actions
- Scaffold Terraform reusable modules and CI/CD workflows under `ci/`.
- Author runbooks, release checklists, and Exa reference stubs with validation TODOs.
- Implement provider-specific Terraform resources after MCP validation of best practices.
- Wire GitHub Actions reusable workflows per ADR-0003 across repos.

Artifacts produced
- DevOps docs skeleton ready for expansion.
- CI/CD stubs and GitHub Actions workflow.
- Terraform module placeholders with explainers and TODO markers.
- Runbooks and release checklist aligned to workflows.
- Developer scripts for onboarding/testing/deploy orchestration.
