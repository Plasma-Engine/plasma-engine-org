### 2025-09-25

Actions:
- Initialized Terraform scaffolding under `infra/terraform/` with modules for networking, compute, storage, IAM, observability, security. Added explainer comments and TODO markers.
- Added `infra/terraform/envs/dev` composition with placeholders for providers and remote state.
- Created DevOps documentation scaffold under `docs/devops/` including this activity log.

Commands Run:
- git status -sb (confirm branch and cleanliness)
- git rev-parse --show-toplevel (confirm repo root)
 - scripts/dev-validate.sh (local fmt/lint/test harness)

Outcomes:
- Repo is on branch `cursor/implement-full-devops-stack-and-documentation-f0f8`; working tree clean at start.
- Terraform modules created; provider selection is pending.
 - Validation summary: terraform/ruff/black/pytest not installed locally; eslint ran but missing new flat config. No blocking failures because validations are best-effort until toolchains are installed.

Unresolved / TODOs:
- # TODO: Select cloud provider(s) and configure remote state backend.
- # TODO: Implement provider-specific resources in modules and wire outputs.
- # TODO: Add CI/CD reusable workflows and calling pipelines.
- # TODO: Add runbooks, release checklists, and playbooks aligned with automation.
- # TODO: Integrate Rube MCP for external lookups; MCP not configured in this workspace.
 - # TODO: Install local toolchains (terraform, ruff, black, pytest, node) or rely on CI containers.

Next Actions:
- Add reusable CI workflows under `ci/` and `.github/workflows` callers.
- Author initial playbooks and runbooks stubs with citations.
- Create scripts for onboarding, local testing, research, and deployment orchestration.

Dependencies Needed:
- Cloud provider decision and credentials for IaC plan/apply.
- Exa API access and schemas to mirror in `docs/exa/` (retrieve via Rube MCP).
