Explainer: Chronological log of DevOps build-out activities. Each entry
captures commands, outputs, artifacts, open questions, and next actions,
so parallel agents can continue seamlessly.

## 2025-09-25

### Context
Workspace mounted at `/workspace`. Full monorepo path provided by user is not
mounted here, so work proceeds in this workspace with mirrored structure.

### Actions
- Created DevOps docs scaffold: `docs/devops/README.md`, `runbooks/`,
  `release/`, `playbooks/`, and this activity log.
- Started planning Terraform module scaffold under `plasma-engine-infra/`.
 - Added Terraform modules: `networking`, `compute`, `storage`, `iam`,
   `observability`, `security` with explainer comments and TODOs.
 - Composed `envs/dev` Terraform to wire modules.
 - Created CI workflow `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` with annotated stages.
 - Added developer scripts: `scripts/dev-onboard.sh`, `dev-local-validate.sh`,
   `deploy.sh`, and research helpers `scripts/research/`.
 - Scaffolded Exa docs at `docs/exa/` with placeholders for schemas/auth/examples.
 - Added runbooks: degraded performance, failed deploy, security incident; added SOP change management.
 - Added playbooks: secrets management, CI operations. Added Terraform READMEs at root/modules/envs/dev.

### Commands and Outputs
```bash
git status -sb
```
Result: repository present on branch `cursor/build-full-devops-stack-and-operationalize-f0d6`; output captured in workspace shell history.

```bash
./scripts/dev-local-validate.sh
```
Result: Terraform not installed; skipped fmt. No errors.

### Blockers / TODOs
- # TODO: Rube MCP not accessible in this environment; cannot fetch external
  best practices or Exa API schemas directly. Use placeholders and mark gaps.
- # TODO: Confirm whether infra repo should live as submodule or subdirectory.
 - # TODO: Choose cloud provider and finalize provider blocks/backends.

### Next Actions
- Scaffold Terraform reusable modules and dev env wiring.
- Add CI/CD workflows and developer scripts.
- Mirror Exa API docs placeholders and fill in once MCP is available.
 - Add additional runbooks (degraded performance, security incident) and SOPs.
