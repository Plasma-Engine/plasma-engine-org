    Drawing from Amazon's own transformative journey and the expertise
    gained by AWS in 
    managing cloud services at global scale, the AWS Well-Architected
    Framework DevOps Guidance offers a structured approach that
    organizations of all sizes can follow to cultivate a high-velocity,
    security-focused culture capable of delivering substantial business
    value using modern technologies and DevOps best practices.
  </p>
  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

      
    <p>
      In the early 2000s, Amazon went through its own DevOps
      transformation which led to an online bookstore forming the Amazon Web Services
      (AWS) cloud computing division. Today, AWS provides a
      wide range of products and services for global customers that are
      powered by that same innovative DevOps approach. Due to the
      positive effects of this transformation, AWS recognizes the
      significance of DevOps and has been at the forefront of its
      adoption and implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amazon's own journey, along with the collective experience gained
      from assisting customers as they modernize and migrate to the
      cloud, provided insight into the capabilities which we believe
      make DevOps adoption successful. With these learnings, we created
      a collection of modern capabilities that together form a
      comprehensive approach to designing, developing, securing, and
      efficiently operating software at cloud scale.
    </p>
    <p> The content and recommendations outlined within the Well-Architected DevOps Guidance are
      based on our expertise operating and managing services for global customers and serves as a
      customizable reference to fit your organization's requirements. Each organization has unique
      requirements which may deviate from the examples provided here.</p>
    <p><b>There is no one-size-fits-all approach to adopting DevOps. Tailor
        these recommendations to suit your individual environment, quality, and security
        needs.</b>
    </p>

    <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
        <p>
          <b>DevOps Sagas</b> are core
          domains within the software delivery process that collectively
          form AWS DevOps best practices. Together, they form a
          collection of modern capabilities representing a comprehensive
          approach to designing, developing, securing, and efficiently
          operating software at cloud scale. You can use the DevOps
          Sagas as a common definition of what DevOps means to align on
          a shared understanding within your organization.
        </p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>
          <b>Capabilities</b> are repeatable
          mechanisms that an organization can continuously improve to
          sustainably practice DevOps and achieve measurable outcomes.
          Each capability includes best practice indicators, metrics,
          and anti-patterns that can be tracked and refined over time.
          Capabilities encompass a wide range of topics related to the
          associated DevOps Saga. They are not presented in any specific
          order.
        </p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>
          <b>Indicators</b> are a collective term covering best practices
          spanning people, process, and technology. They can be used as qualitative measurements,
          such as a checklist, to objectively assess and continuously track your organization's
          ability to perform a capability. Each indicator contains a prescriptive improvement plan
          that contains high-level guidance for performing it. Indicators can fall into one of three
          categories, which represent importance: </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
           
           
           
        <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
            <p>
              <b>Foundational:</b> Requirements to achieve minimum
              viability of the capability when practicing DevOps. Indicators in this category are
              considered essential for organizations to meet to achieve basic proficiency of the
              capability. </p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>
              <b>Recommended:</b> Recommended best practices and advanced
              techniques that can improve the performance of the capability. Indicators in this
              category offer significant benefits, such as improved security, developer experience,
              speed, reliability, or the ability to optimize implementation in cloud-based
              environments. </p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>
              <b>Optional:</b> Minor adjustments and improvements that
              further enhance the ability to implement the capability or apply only to specific use
              cases. Indicators in this category might not be applicable to all organizations or
              workloads, but can provide additional benefits to some. </p>
          </li></ul></div>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>
          <b>Anti-patterns</b> are practices that might seem beneficial
          initially, but have the potential to lead to unexpected or negative outcomes. They are
          indicators that we have seen slow down or halt our customer's progress when adopting
          DevOps within their organizations. Identifying and addressing anti-patterns can help you
          to avoid pitfalls and optimize the chance for successful DevOps adoption. </p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>
          <b>Metrics</b> are quantifiable measures of an organization's
          ability to perform the associated capability. Think of indicators as the
            <em>how</em> and metrics as the <em>how well</em> when using
          this guidance to measure your organization's ability to implement a capability. There is
          no one-size-fits-all approach to selecting which metrics to track. We provide metrics for
          each capability as a starting point. Each organization needs to determine which metrics
          are important to their business. Consider using additional frameworks, such as <a href="https://dora.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA)</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a> and <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3454124" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>SPACE</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a>, to further customize
          the metrics we provide so that they align to your organizational goals. </p>
