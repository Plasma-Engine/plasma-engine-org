### Release Docs

This directory contains release processes, readiness checklists, and rollback procedures.

- Each document will include: an explainer paragraph, roles/responsibilities, gates, verification criteria, and citations to DORA/AWS/Google SRE guidance. Embedded TODOs will capture org-specific inputs.
- Operational runbooks live in `../runbooks/`. Broader lifecycle guidance lives in `../playbooks/`.
