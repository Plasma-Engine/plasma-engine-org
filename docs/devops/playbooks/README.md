### DevOps Playbooks

This directory contains modular, heavily commented playbooks that mirror the DevOps lifecycle (Plan → Code → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor).

- Each playbook will include: an explainer paragraph, actionable steps, embedded TODOs for org-specific inputs, and citations to authoritative sources (CNCF, DORA, AWS, Google SRE).
- Do not duplicate runbooks; keep how-to/step-by-step troubleshooting in `../runbooks/`.

Contents will be added in separate files per lifecycle phase.
