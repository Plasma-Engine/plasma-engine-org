### Plan Playbook

This playbook defines how we plan work, shape scope, and set measurable outcomes aligned to product and reliability goals.

#### Objectives
- Align scope with business goals and reliability targets (SLOs, error budgets).
- Produce clear issues/specs, acceptance criteria, and risk assessments.

#### Practices
- Define SLIs/SLOs early with stakeholders. Reference SRE SLO guidance.
