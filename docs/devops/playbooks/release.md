### Release Playbook

This playbook governs release candidate promotion, change control, and verification prior to production.

#### Objectives
- Reduce change failure rate while maintaining deployment frequency.
- Ensure rollback readiness and compliance sign-offs.

#### Practices
- Use environments with gated promotions (dev → staging → prod) and approvals.
