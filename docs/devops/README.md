# DevOps Overview

This directory contains the operational documentation and automation blueprints for the Plasma Engine platform. It is the single source of truth for infrastructure-as-code, CI/CD workflows, runbooks, release management, security/compliance, and operational standards.

Contents:
- `runbooks/` – operational runbooks and SOPs for common scenarios
- `release/` – release checklists, procedures, and rollback guidance
- `playbooks/` – prescriptive playbooks referenced by CI/CD workflows
- `activity-log.md` – chronological activity log for changes performed by automation and agents

Authoritative sources and references are cited inline. Items requiring organization-specific input are marked as TODOs to enable parallel agent execution.

Limitations and External Lookups:
- Preferred external lookup path is via Rube MCP. If unavailable in the execution environment, add inline `# TODO:` markers and cite the intended source to be validated later.

# TODO: Confirm organizational requirements for environments (dev, staging, prod) and naming standards.
