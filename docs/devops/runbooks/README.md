### DevOps Runbooks

This directory contains operational runbooks and SOPs for common scenarios (incident response, on-call procedures, backup/restore, security reviews).

- Each runbook includes: an explainer paragraph, prerequisites, decision trees, step-by-step actions, verification, and rollback/mitigation steps. Embedded TODOs will capture org-specific owners/inputs.
- Keep strategic lifecycle guidance in `../playbooks/` and release processes in `../release/`.
