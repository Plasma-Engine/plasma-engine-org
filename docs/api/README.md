# Plasma Engine API Documentation

This placeholder will evolve into the full API reference once individual
services expose stable contracts. For now it documents how to access local
OpenAPI and GraphQL schemas generated by the new scaffolds.

- Gateway GraphQL playground: `http://localhost:4000/graphql`
- Research OpenAPI docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- Brand OpenAPI docs: `http://localhost:8001/docs`
- Content OpenAPI docs: `http://localhost:8002/docs`
- Agent OpenAPI docs: `http://localhost:8003/docs`

Each service README now points to its health endpoint and boot instructions.
As endpoints are implemented, add schema change notes and example requests
here so the organisation README remains accurate.
