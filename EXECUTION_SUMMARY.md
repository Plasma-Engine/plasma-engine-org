## üöÄ GPT-5 Integration Details (Latest 2025 API)

### Model Variants & Pricing
- **gpt-5**: Complex reasoning ($1.25/1M input, $10/1M output)
- **gpt-5-mini**: Balanced ($0.25/1M input, $2/1M output)
- **gpt-5-nano**: High-throughput ($0.05/1M input, $0.40/1M output)

### Intelligent Routing Implementation
```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

# For simple social posts - use minimal effort + low verbosity
response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5-nano",
    input=prompt,
    reasoning={"effort": "minimal"},
    text={"verbosity": "low"}
)

# For complex blog posts - use high effort + high verbosity
response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    input=prompt,
    reasoning={"effort": "high"},
    text={"verbosity": "high"}
)
```

### Advanced Features
- **Context Window**: 272K input + 128K output (400K total)
- **Prompt Caching**: 90% discount ($0.125/1M cached tokens)
- **Custom Tools**: CFG support for structured outputs
- **Preambles**: Transparent reasoning before tool calls

for port in 3000 8000 8001 8002 8003; do
  echo "=== Service on port $port ==="
  curl http://localhost:$port/health
done

# Stop all services
