# Plasma Engine Terraform

This directory contains Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) for Plasma Engine using Terraform.

Contents:
- modules/: Reusable modules for networking, compute, storage, IAM, observability, and security
- envs/: Environment compositions (e.g., dev, prod) wiring modules with environment-specific inputs

Conventions:
- Every `.tf` file starts with a top-of-file explainer and inline references to authoritative docs
- All organization-specific inputs are marked with `# TODO:`
- Variables are declared with descriptions and types; outputs document consumers
