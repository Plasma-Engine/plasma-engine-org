# CI/CD Workflows

This directory holds production-ready workflow definitions for build, test, security, package, deploy, and rollback. Each workflow is annotated with purpose, inputs, outputs, and references to playbooks under `docs/devops/playbooks/`.

# TODO: Mirror or wire these to the chosen runner (e.g., GitHub Actions under `.github/workflows/`).
